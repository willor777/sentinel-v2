- Notes + Ideas for the project



- Animation:
    - When ever numbers update (stock prices, volume, etc) you should use an animation where
    the old number slides up to leaving from the top, and the new number slides up entering from the
    bottom.
    - An example of this can be found on reddit in an active thread post. When people like a post
    it updates real time with the slide up animations.
    - This animation would look especially good if all of the composables did it at the same time.


- Animation:
    - When the scanner is started, it would be cool if the icon was a guy "jogging" and when
    clicked, He actually animates and starts jogging.
    - An example of a runner guy icon is in the Material Design Icons.Filled.RunCircle
